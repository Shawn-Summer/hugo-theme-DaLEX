“Life is not just about the petty struggles in front of us; it also includes poetry and the distant horizon.” This sentence reminds us to hold on to our dreams and yearn for the vastness of the distant world. It encourages people not to forget their innermost longing for beautiful things in the hustle and bustle of daily life.
